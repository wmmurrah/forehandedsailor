The title of this website is much more of an aspiration than assertion.
The goal of the site is to document my journey to become a forehanded sailor.
The initial purpose of this site is as a repository for the information to document what I have done to become a sailor, and to help me plan future projects and adventures.
I hope it might also be helpful to others.
